Zenimal Sleep Aids are great, the hardware is really good, rugged, travels well. All good things.  BUT they use proprietary audio formats and won't let you use your own microsd cards.

But I've had one of their $20 microsd cards fail and due to their proprietary format I can't replace it. Their $20 memory cards are sold as-is and have no warranty. I abhore closed systems. Charge me more for the hardware and let me bring my own files! But they'd rather have a tiny, flimsy, microsd card that is bound to fail so you have to buy another $20 proprietary replacement. I've check on my PC and the card is a 500MB SD Card. I can get a 6-pack on Amazon for $15.

### **NOTE: I am not condoning piracy of Zenimal's Sleep Companion tracks or audio. I just want to be able to use and repair my own hardware device I've purchased.**

Rather than keep replacing microsd cards I want someone to free this system. Reverse Engineer Zenimal's hardware device and determine how we can load our own microsd cards.

Successful implementation looks like:
* Determine Zenimals Proprietary format or encryption
* Determine methodology for loading 3rd-party audio on Zenimals device
* Determine if we can use sd cards larger than 512MB

Lets free this system and help everyone sleep better!
